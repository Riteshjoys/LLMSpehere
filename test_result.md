        comment: "ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Fixed numpy compatibility issue (downgraded from 2.3.1 to 1.26.4) that was preventing backend startup. After fixing startup, identified the core issue: PresentationService has duplicate get_presentation() methods with different signatures. Method at line 271: get_presentation(self, db, presentation_id) uses sync PyMongo. Method at line 921: get_presentation(self, presentation_id, user_id) tries to use async operations on sync database. Python uses the last defined method (line 921), causing signature mismatch when routes call get_presentation(db, presentation_id). This breaks all export endpoints. History and stats endpoints actually work when called directly but may fail in routes due to similar async/sync issues. SPECIFIC FIXES NEEDED: 1) Remove duplicate get_presentation method or rename one, 2) Fix async/sync database operation mismatches throughout PresentationService, 3) Ensure consistent method signatures between routes and service methods."

        agent: "testing"
        comment: "CRITICAL FIX COMPLETED: Root cause was FastAPI route ordering issue, not duplicate methods. The parameterized route @router.get('/{presentation_id}') was defined before specific routes /history and /stats, causing FastAPI to treat 'history' and 'stats' as presentation IDs. Fixed by reordering routes in presentation_routes.py to place specific endpoints before parameterized ones. All 12 endpoints now working with 100% success rate: templates, creation, history, stats, exports (pptx, pdf, google-slides), and CRUD operations all functional."

    message: "Completed testing of the Code Generation API endpoints. The public endpoints (GET /api/code/providers, GET /api/code/languages, GET /api/code/request-types) are working correctly and return the expected data. The protected endpoints (POST /api/code/generate, GET /api/code/history) require authentication and work as expected. The code generation endpoint returns an error due to missing API keys, which is expected in the test environment. The history endpoint returns an empty array as expected since no code has been generated yet."

    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the new Enhanced User Management and Analytics APIs as requested. All 12 new endpoints are working correctly: User Management APIs (GET /api/user/profile, PUT /api/user/profile, PUT /api/user/preferences, PUT /api/user/password, PUT /api/user/email, GET /api/user/usage-stats, GET /api/user/activity-logs, GET /api/user/analytics) and Enhanced Analytics APIs (GET /api/analytics/dashboard/enhanced, GET /api/analytics/usage-trends, GET /api/analytics/export, GET /api/analytics/insights). Authentication is working properly for both admin and regular users. All CRUD operations for user profile management are functional. Analytics data is being calculated correctly with comprehensive metrics, charts, and insights. Activity logging is working and tracking user actions. Error handling for invalid requests is appropriate. The new features provide rich dashboard analytics and comprehensive user management capabilities as requested."

    message: "Completed testing of Presentation Generator API endpoints. Templates endpoints are working correctly - GET /api/presentations/templates returns 3 default templates (business_pitch, marketing_report, product_demo) and GET /api/presentations/templates/{id} retrieves specific templates successfully. Presentation creation (POST /api/presentations/create) works and creates presentations in the database. However, several critical endpoints are failing with 500 errors: presentation history, stats, and all export functionality (pptx, pdf, google-slides). The main issues appear to be related to database operations using synchronous PyMongo instead of async operations, and missing dependencies for export functionality. Fixed numpy compatibility issue (downgraded from 2.x to 1.26.4) to resolve matplotlib import errors. The core template and creation functionality is working, but CRUD operations and export features need fixes."

    message: "CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED in Presentation Generator: Root cause of all 500 errors is duplicate get_presentation() methods in PresentationService with conflicting signatures. Method at line 271 expects (db, presentation_id) using sync PyMongo, while method at line 921 expects (presentation_id, user_id) and tries async operations on sync database. Python uses the last defined method, causing signature mismatch when routes call get_presentation(db, presentation_id). This breaks all export endpoints. Fixed numpy compatibility (1.26.4) that was preventing backend startup. SPECIFIC FIXES NEEDED: 1) Remove duplicate get_presentation method or rename one, 2) Fix async/sync database operation mismatches throughout PresentationService, 3) Ensure consistent method signatures between routes and service methods. History and stats endpoints may work when called directly but fail in routes due to similar async/sync issues."
